**Bank Transactions 7/14**

1. Create a new class for a bank account
2. Create fields for the following:
   account number = 123456789
   balance = 50.0
   customer name = yourname
   email = your email address
   phone number = your phone number
3. Create three methods in the class:
   To allow the customer to deposit funds (this should increment the balance field).
   To allow the customer to withdraw funds. This should deduct
   from the balance field, but not allow the withdrawal to complete if
   there are insufficient
   funds and print the balance with name of customer
4. Create another method to print Customer Name, Account Number, Balance, Email and Phone Number
5. Create another class with main method for entry point of your program
   Give user options to Show Account Balance, Deposit Money, Withdraw Money and Exit out of program

   Add some System.out.println's in all methods above as well.
6. Push code in git repository
   NOTE: Use scanner library for user input and also all OOPs concepts to implement the code.
